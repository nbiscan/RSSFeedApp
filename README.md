# RSS Feed App

An RSS Feed app built with SwiftUI, following Clean Architecture and SOLID principles. The app allows users to add, view, and delete RSS feeds, enable push notifications for specific feeds, and get notified of new items. Users can also mark feeds as favorites, search through feeds, and persist them locally on the device.

## Features

* Add and Remove Feeds: Easily add RSS feeds by URL and remove unwanted feeds.
* Push Notifications: Enable notifications on specific feeds to receive alerts when new items are available.
* View Feed Details: Display items within each feed, including images, titles, and descriptions.
* Favorites: Mark feeds as favorites for quick access.
* Search Functionality: Search through feeds for specific titles.
* Persistence: Save feed URLs, favorites, and notification preferences locally for a seamless experience on relaunch.
